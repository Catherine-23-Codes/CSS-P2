<!-- COMBINATOR Types
 combinators are used to add two or more selectors together

 1) SIBILING COMBINATOR
 
 eg-- p+h3{
            p:v;
        }

NOTE: <p> and <h> tags are always on the same level, so they are considered as
            sibiling tags

            BUT
        <div> <p> <h> are all forming a hierarchy so they are parent child relationship


2) Child combinator 
eg-- span> button{
                p:v;
                }
